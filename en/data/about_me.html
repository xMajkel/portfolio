Welcome<br>My name is Michał Adamski, I'm 22 years old and I'm a programmer<br>
I've created this page to present my portfolio in a bit more interesting way.<br>
<h3>Briefly about me</h3>
Jestem osobą cichą i spokojną, rzadko kiedy się denerwuję. Od dziecka uwielbiałem LEGO, wszystko co pobudzało moją kreatywność oraz łamigówki. 
I am a quiet and calm person, I rarely get upset. Since I was a kid, I loved LEGO, puzzles and anything that sparked my creativity.
Solving problems and riddles is my thing, which is probably why I like programming so much. Outside of it, I'm interested in automobiles, 
technical innovations and the IT industry in general.
<h3>My history with programming</h3>
My first contact with programming was in elementary school, when the teacher showed us the Baltie program, 
which interested me enough that I took part in a competition based on this program.<br>
However, the real programming adventure begins at the end of middle school. 
At that time, I saw on YouTube a series of livestreams of the creation of a computer game. 
That was it! At that point, all I wanted to do was create my own game. 
My choice was the Unity engine and the C# language it supports. 
The beginnings were very difficult due to the fact that up to that point my programming had actually consisted solely of putting puzzles together,
rather than writing lines of code. After a few months, however, I managed to create my first game, it was an endless runner.
After this achievement, I started a few more projects, but I didn't finish any of them, and a break came.
I finished my next major project before high school graduation, it was a game about a chicken destroying a city.
However, I did not develop this game more, as my time was consumed by other activities, and eventually my college.<br><hr>
Details of my activities can be found in the other "directories" :D.<br><br>
