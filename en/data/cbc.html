<h3>Description</h3>
"Chicken's Big Crush" is a voxel-style game about a chicken that destroys a city. The amount of things demolished causes a snowball effect because it 
affects the size of the chicken, and thus with the size of the objects it is able to smash.<br>
All elements of the game were created by me (except for the sound effects and the chicken model) and in order to increase the uniqueness of 
each round I implemented some elements of randomness.
