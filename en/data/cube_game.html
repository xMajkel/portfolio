<h3>Description</h3>
"Cube Game" is my first game, an endless runner. The player, in unlimited time, must score as many points as possible by avoiding obstacles. When he fails to do so he loses, and the game starts from the beginning. Even for those times it was a trivial production, but it allowed me to 
me to progress a lot and allowed me to have something that's mine.
