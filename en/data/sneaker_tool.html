<h3>Description</h3>
Sneaker Tool is the dev name for a complete application requested by the client that works around the subject of limited and rare clothing 
products of the (mainly shoes). My task was to create, develop, test and troubleshoot both the consumer app and the backend. As per the requirements, 
I used the Python language for both. For the database responsible for accessing the program, the limit of daily uses of its modules and the collection 
of diagnostic data, I used mySQL. At the request of the client, I do not share the inner workings of the program, but it was mostly based on requests 
to external servers, the handling of the returned data and the execution of the corresponding actions. The program got quite a lot of attention and 
garnered enough positive feedback that after about six months an improved version was ordered.
