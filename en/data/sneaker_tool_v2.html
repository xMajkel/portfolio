<h3>Description</h3>
Sneaker Tool v2 is an enhanced version of its precursor. The main reason to refresh the program was the insufficient performance caused by the Python 
language, as it became clear that from the code side it was impossible to make improvements and the nature of the interpreted language limited the 
overall speed. The choice came down to GO, which I was already familiar with and liked very much, especially because of its good support for 
multithreading. My tasks remained the same (creation, development, testing and troubleshooting), in addition, I also decided to move the backend to 
GO. While writing the program I became familiar with the Git software for managing versions and changes between them.
